Note: since the script rewrites the data file, the data file must be restored
to its original state before running the all_actions file as in input.
Otherwise, running **diff files/ref_output files/all_ouput** will show
differences - when I reset the data file, diff showed no output. I was able to
implement every command and all the extra credit.
